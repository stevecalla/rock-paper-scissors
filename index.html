    <h2>What are the rules of RPS?</h2>
    <p> 
      Although the game has a lot of complexity to it, the rules to play it are pretty simple.
      The game is played where players deliver hand signals that will represent the elements of the game; rock, paper and scissors. The outcome of the game is determined by 3 simple rules:

    <ul>
      <li>
        Rock wins against scissors.
      </li>
